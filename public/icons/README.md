# Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16px icon
- `icon48.png` - 48x48px icon
- `icon128.png` - 128x128px icon

You can create these using any image editing tool. They should represent the ColorDetective brand/functionality.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares as temporary icons until proper designs are ready.
